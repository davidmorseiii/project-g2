# Project-G2 Trivia CLI Game

## Overview
This is a command-line based trivia game written in Python. The game loads multiple-choice questions from a JSON file and quizzes the player one question at a time. It tracks the player's score, gives feedback after each answer, and shows the final results at the end. The project is designed to be modular and will eventually support a graphical user interface (GUI) in a future release.

## Features
