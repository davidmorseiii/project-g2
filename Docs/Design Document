Introduction:
  The Trivia Game is a command line interface, multiple choice, trivia game.  
  Once the game begins questions are presented to the screen and the player
  can choose from a, b, c, or d to select the correct choice.  The player can
  keep score and quit any time or challenge themselves by answering all the questions.
Design Considerations:
  Upon selection of a program that would be more difficult than "paper, rock, scissors"
  but not so difficult that focus could not be kept on team interactions and group
  participation the Trivia Game was selected by popular vote. Using the command line 
  interface was a requirement and a string multiple choice answer was selected in order
  to keep game play simple but allow for the need to convert from an index value.
Architectural Stragedies:
  In order to form the program the game has been broken into functions and classes.
  There will be a "main.py" program file that runs all code. In main.py there will be a
  call to "cli.py" which starts and controls the game interface and then calls to
  "game.py" which runs the game. A Questions structure will call in the ".json" list 
  of dictionaries for the game and Question objects will be used to run each trivia
  question.
Further Development:
  Future designs will most likely include a scoreboard and a graphical user interace
  to improve game quality - in any case the true nature of development in this course
  will be to foster team building and to pursue software development through
  collaboration.
