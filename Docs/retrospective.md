## Performance
We rotated roles throughout the project, giving everyone exposure to different tasks. Each team member contributed meaningfully to the codebase. Attendance at meetings was consistent, and everyone made an effort to coordinate and stay aligned.

## Challenges Faced
We lost a team member early on, which required us to redistribute work. ZenHub caused workflow issues and slowed us down until we found better alternatives. Finishing the project on time without breaking existing features was a constant balancing act.

## Key Takeaways
Group work introduces challenges you donâ€™t face when working alone, especially around coordination and expectations. Good team communication and structure are critical to delivering a successful outcome. Clean, consistent coding practices make collaboration smoother and reduce friction.
