# Code Inspection Checklist – Trivia Game Project

## 1. `Question` class (`question.py`)

| Code Formatting & Style | Uses proper indentation. attribuye names are all lowercase (`prompt`, `options`, `answer`) so intent is obvious. |
| Correctness & Completeness | Stores the question text and choices correctly. lacks perfect validation that `answer` is in the 0‑3 range, leaving room for bad data to slip in. |
| Efficiency | Minimal logic no performance concerns. |
| Error Handling | Raises no exceptions when bad input is passed. |
| Documentation & Comments | Doc‑string explains each parameter, but a short example in the docstring would help newcomers. |
| Security | Clas holds no sensitive data, so no immediate risk. |
| Portability & Maintainability | No hard‑coded literals. can be reused in other UIs (CLI, Flask) without modification. |


## 2. `GameEngine` class (`game_engine.py`)

| Code Formatting & Style | Mostly consistent. mehtod names such as `next_question()` and `check_answer()` use snake_case, but `loadQuestionsJson()` breaks the pattern—rename to `load_questions_json` for uniformity. |
| Correctness & Completeness | Core loop delivers random questions and tallies score accurately. edge‑case when `questions` list is empty ends in an uncaught `IndexError`. |
| Efficiency | Each call to `next_question()` pops the first element—using `collections.deque` would give O(1) pops instead of O(n) shifts, even though n is small. |
| Error Handling | Missing guard when an anwser index outside 0‑3 is submitted. a graceful error message would improve UX. |
| Documentation & Comments | High‑level doc‑string exists, but complex scoring logic could use inline comments. |
| Security | No direct DB or file IO here, so attack surface is tiny. |
| Portability & Maintainability | Engine only depends on the `Question` interface, making it easy to swap storage layers. all magic numbers (max score per question) are constants at the top – good practice. |


## 3. `QuestionRepository` class (`question_repository.py`)

| Code Formatting & Style | Follows naming rules, but mixing tabs and spaces in one section makes diffs messy convert to spaces. |
| Correctness & Completeness | Correctly reads JSON and instantiates `Question` objects. lacks validation for missing keys, so a malformed JSON node would crash things |
| Efficiency | Reads entire file into memory, fine for around 100 questions. if the set grows large consider streaming or pagination. |
| Error Handling | Wraps file IO in `try/except` but prints errors rather than logging—switch to Python `logging` module for better traceability. |
| Documentation & Comments | File header briefly states purpose. adding expected JSON schema in comments would guide future maintainers. |
| Security | No SQL, but file path comes from caller. validate or clean paths to avoid directory traversal bugs. |
| Portability & Maintainability | File path currently hard‑coded. accepting a path parameter (with default) would make it reusable in tests. |


## 4. `CLIInterface` class (`cli_interface.py`)

| Code Formatting & Style | Function names clear (`display_question`, `get_user_choice`) |
| Correctness & Completeness | Correctly loops through `GameEngine` until questions are exhausted. does not clear the console between questions |
| Efficiency | Pure I/O bound. negligible CPU usage. |
| Error Handling | Validates that user enters 1‑4. incorrect entries re‑prompt, preventing crashes. |
| Documentation & Comments | Inline comments match each step, but top‑level class docstring is missing—add for clarity. |
| Security | CLI variant has no external attack spots |
| Portability & Maintainability | Reads directly from `stdin`/`stdout`. easily portable. No hard‑coded ANSI escapes, so it works on Windows and Unix. |


### Summary

 Needed Changes:  
  * Add input validation & explicit exceptions in `Question` and `GameEngine`.  
  * Replace mixed tabs/spaces in `QuestionRepository`.  
  * Rename `loadQuestionsJson()` to `load_questions_json()` for style consistency.  
  * Introduce proper logging for repository file errors.
