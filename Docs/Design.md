"Trivia games are fun! Something I'm looking for in a trivia game is a way to 
answer many quesions but quit any time.  I want to be able to keep track of my score as I go too."

"I need a game where if I push the wrong button it doesn't freak out on me.  If I push the wrong button
I either want it to tell me, ignore the wrong button, or explain what I should do next."

Trivia Game (Name Needed):
First start/load the game.  There will be a welcome message and options to begin or quit.  
When the game starts the screen is cleared and a trivia question is presented with options.
The options will be labled a, b, c, d or q.  If you push the wrong button you can try again.
The score will be kept in the corner of the screen (optionally there may be a high score kept with 
the top 10 scores - if you get a top score you couldenter your initials).
If you push q the game quits.
